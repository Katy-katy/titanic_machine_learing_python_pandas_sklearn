# Predict survival on Titanic using Python, Pandas, Sklearn, numpy, matplotlib
This project is an assignment for CMPS_142 "Machine Learning" class at University of California Santa Cruz.
We used dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic and then we submitted our work to this site to see how good our algorithm works with new data.
Please, see "titanic_report.pdf" file for more details.
