# Predict survival on Titanic using Python, Pandas, Sklearn, numpy, matplotlib

This project is an assignment for CMPS_142 "Machine Learning" class at University of California Santa Cruz.

We used dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic and then we submitted our work to this site to see how good our algorithm works with new data.

Using gradient boosting classifier with random forest I got accuracy 0.79904

For this assignment we got 18 points or 18 possible and a comment that our result is very good.
