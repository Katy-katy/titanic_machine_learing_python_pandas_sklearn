# Predict survival on Titanic using Python, Pandas, Sklearn, numpy, matplotlib

This project is an assignment for CMPS_142 "Machine Learning" class at University of California Santa Cruz.

We used dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic and then we submitted our work to this site to see how good our algorithm works with new data.
Initially we had:

![Mockup for feature A](https://github.com/Katy-katy/titanic_machine_learing_python_pandas_sklearn/blob/master/initial_data.png)
We have some information about passengers:

PassengerId -- A numerical id assigned to each passenger.
Survived -- Whether the passenger survived (1), or didn't (0). We'll be making predictions for this column.
Pclass -- The class the passenger was in -- first class (1), second class (2), or third class (3).
Name -- the name of the passenger.
Sex -- The gender of the passenger -- male or female.

Age -- The age of the passenger. Fractional.

SibSp -- The number of siblings and spouses the passenger had on board.

Parch -- The number of parents and children the passenger had on board.

Ticket -- The ticket number of the passenger.

Fare -- How much the passenger paid for the ticker.

Cabin -- Which cabin the passenger was in.

Embarked -- Where the passenger boarded the Titanic.



Using gradient boosting classifier with random forest I got accuracy 0.79904

For this assignment we got 18 points or 18 possible and a comment that our result is very good.
